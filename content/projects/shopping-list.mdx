This is a small webapp written in Svelte using TailwindCSS for styling 💅. For back-end I'm using Firebase (Firestore) and observables to keep the data fresh Authentication is done through Google.

The data structure is simple, you have shopping lists which as shopping items. You can add/remove/edit items to a list, and add and remove lists. You can also store settings which are stored in the local storage.

The project is hosted on Netlify (Thank you Netlify 🙏) and it utilizes their functions (serverless functions) for enables user to scrape recipes and adding items to their shoppings list using cheerio
