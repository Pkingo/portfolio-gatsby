This is actually this site. I made this using Gatsby (React) as the framework, MDX for content and styled-components for for styling 💅. The images are hosted on a CDN (Thank you Cloudinary free tier 🙏) and using Gatsby Images to display them in a nice and fast manner.

I made this website after doing Wes Bos Master [Gatsby course](https://mastergatsby.com/), so must of the techniques used in this project are base on thanks I learned from him
