        This is a collection of code snippet that I find myself use often or
        code snippet that I find neat. These snippets are not "novice" but code
        I often find myself thinking "how is it you do that thing" or small code
        snippet that is done in a cool/inspiring way. I often copy code from
        here, feel free to do the same
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I have not written all of these code
        snippet myself, but often found some code online that I developed
        further and decide to keep, so that I could easily find them again
